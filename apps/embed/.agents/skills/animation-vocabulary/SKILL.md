# Animation Vocabulary

A glossary of common animation patterns. Use these names to describe what you want when prompting an AI.

## Entrances & Exits

How elements appear and disappear.

- **Fade in / Fade out** — Element appears or disappears by changing opacity.
- **Slide in** — Element enters by sliding in from off-screen (left, right, top, or bottom).
- **Scale in** — Element grows from smaller to full size as it appears, often paired with a fade.
- **Pop in** — Element appears with a slight overshoot, like it bounces into place.
- **Reveal** — Content is uncovered gradually, often by animating a clip-path or mask.
- **Enter / Exit** — The animation an element plays when it's added to or removed from the screen.

## Sequencing & Timing

Coordinating multiple elements or moments.

- **Keyframes** — Defined points in an animation (0%, 50%, 100%) that the browser fills the gaps between.
- **Interpolation / Tween** — Generating all the in-between frames between a start and end value, so motion is continuous.
- **Stagger** — Animate several items one after another with a small delay between each, creating a cascade.
- **Orchestration** — Deliberately timing multiple animations so they feel like one coordinated motion.
- **Delay** — Time before an animation starts.
- **Duration** — How long an animation takes.
- **Fill mode** — Whether an element keeps its first or last frame's styles before the animation starts or after it ends (e.g. `forwards`).
- **Stepped animation** — An animation that is divided into discrete steps, like a countdown timer.

## Movement & Transforms

Changing an element's position, size, or angle.

- **Translate** — Move an element along the X or Y axis.
- **Scale** — Make an element bigger or smaller.
- **Rotate** — Spin an element around a point.
- **Skew** — Slant an element along the X or Y axis, shearing it out of its rectangular shape.
- **3D tilt / Flip** — Rotate in 3D space (rotateX / rotateY) to add depth.
- **Perspective** — How strong the 3D effect looks — a lower value exaggerates depth, like the viewer is closer.
- **Transform origin** — The anchor point a scale or rotation grows or spins from.
- **Origin-aware animation** — An element animates out of its trigger, like a popover growing from the button that opened it instead of from its own center.

## Transitions Between States

Connecting one state, view, or element to another.

- **Crossfade** — One element fades out as another fades in, in the same spot.
- **Continuity transition** — A change that keeps the user oriented by visually connecting before and after.
- **Morph** — One shape smoothly turns into another shape.
- **Shared element transition** — An element travels and transforms from one position into another, like a thumbnail expanding into a card.
- **Layout animation** — When an element's size or position changes, it animates to the new spot instead of snapping.
- **Accordion / Collapse** — A section smoothly expands and collapses its height to show or hide content.
- **Direction-aware transition** — Content slides one way going forward and the opposite way going back.

## Scroll

Motion tied to scrolling or navigating between views.

- **Scroll reveal** — Elements fade or slide into place as they enter the viewport.
- **Scroll-driven animation** — An animation whose progress is tied directly to scroll position.
- **Parallax** — Background and foreground move at different speeds while scrolling, creating depth.
- **Page transition** — An animation that plays when navigating from one page or route to another.
- **View transition** — The browser morphs between two states or pages, connecting shared elements.

## Feedback & Interaction

Responding to the user's actions.

- **Hover effect** — Visual change when the cursor moves over an element.
- **Press / Tap feedback** — A subtle scale-down when an element is clicked, so it feels physical.
- **Hold to confirm** — A progress effect that fills up while the user holds a button.
- **Drag** — Moving an element by grabbing it, often with momentum when released.
- **Drag to reorder** — Dragging items in a list to rearrange them, while the others shift to make room.
- **Swipe to dismiss** — Dragging an element off-screen to close it, like a drawer or toast.
- **Rubber-banding** — Resistance and snap-back when you drag past a boundary.
- **Shake / Wiggle** — A quick side-to-side jitter signaling an error or rejected input.
- **Ripple** — A circle expanding from the point of a tap, confirming the press.

## Easing

How speed changes over an animation.

- **Easing** — The rate at which an animation speeds up or slows down.
- **Ease-out** — Starts fast, ends slow. Default for most UI and anything responding to the user.
- **Ease-in** — Starts slow, ends fast. Usually avoided; can feel sluggish.
- **Ease-in-out** — Slow, fast, slow. Good for elements already on screen moving from A to B.
- **Linear** — Constant speed. Avoid for UI; reserve for spinners or marquees.
- **Cubic-bezier** — A custom easing curve you define for precise control.
- **Asymmetric easing** — A curve that accelerates and decelerates at different rates. Feels more alive than a symmetric one.

## Spring Animations

Physics-based motion as an alternative to fixed-duration easing.

- **Spring** — Motion driven by physics (tension, mass, damping) rather than a set duration.
- **Stiffness / Tension** — How strongly the spring pulls toward its target. Higher feels snappier.
- **Damping** — How quickly a spring settles. Lower damping means more bounce and oscillation.
- **Mass** — How heavy the animated element feels. More mass makes it slower and more sluggish.
- **Bounce** — A spring that overshoots and settles, adding playfulness.
- **Perceptual duration** — How long a spring feels finished, even though it keeps micro-settling underneath.
- **Momentum** — Motion that carries velocity, especially after a drag or interruption.
- **Velocity** — How fast and in which direction an element is moving.
- **Interruptible animation** — An animation that can be smoothly redirected mid-flight instead of finishing first.

## Looping & Ambient Motion

Animations that run on their own.

- **Marquee** — Text or content that scrolls continuously in a loop.
- **Loop** — An animation that repeats, a set number of times or infinitely.
- **Alternate (yoyo)** — A loop that plays forward then reverses each iteration.
- **Orbit** — An element circling around another in a continuous path.
- **Pulse** — A gentle repeating scale or opacity change to draw attention.
- **Float** — A gentle, continuous up-and-down drift that makes a static element feel alive and weightless.
- **Idle animation** — Subtle motion that plays while an element is just sitting there.

## Polish & Effects

The small touches that separate good from great.

- **Blur** — A blur filter used to soften an element or mask tiny imperfections.
- **Clip-path** — Clipping an element to a shape, used for reveals, masks, and before/after sliders.
- **Mask** — Hiding or revealing parts of an element using a shape or gradient.
- **Before / after slider** — A draggable divider that wipes between two overlaid images to compare them.
- **Line drawing** — An SVG path that draws itself in, like an invisible pen tracing it.
- **Text morph** — Text that animates character by character when it changes.
- **Skeleton / Shimmer** — A placeholder with a moving sheen shown while content loads.
- **Number ticker** — Digits rolling or counting up to a value.
- **Tabular numbers** — Fixed-width digits so numbers don't shift around as they change.
- **Typewriter** — Text appearing one character at a time, as if being typed.

## Performance

What keeps motion smooth instead of stuttering.

- **Frame rate (FPS)** — Frames drawn per second. 60fps is the baseline; 120fps on newer displays.
- **Jank** — Visible stutter when the browser drops frames.
- **Dropped frame** — A frame the browser missed its deadline to draw, causing a tiny hitch.
- **Compositing** — Letting the GPU move or fade an element on its own layer without redoing layout or paint.
- **will-change** — A CSS hint that an element is about to animate, so the browser can promote it to its own layer.
- **Layout thrashing** — Animating properties like width, height, top, or left that force layout recalculations every frame.

## Principles to Know

Concepts that guide when and how to animate.

- **Purposeful animation** — Motion should serve a function, not just decorate.
- **Anticipation** — A small wind-up in the opposite direction before a move.
- **Follow-through** — Parts of an element keep moving and settle slightly after the main motion stops.
- **Squash & stretch** — Deforming an element as it moves to convey weight and flexibility.
- **Perceived performance** — The right animation makes an interface feel faster, even when it isn't.
- **Frequency of use** — The more often a user sees an animation, the shorter and subtler it should be.
- **Spatial consistency** — Animating so an element keeps its identity across states.
- **Hardware acceleration** — Animating transform and opacity lets the GPU keep motion smooth.
- **Reduced motion** — Respecting the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting by toning down or removing motion.
